#TODO
-[x] complete day 1 puzzles
-[ ] write a parser to strip out all the presentation extra and just keep the puzzle from a given web page (think I have one of these in Go somewhere)
-[ ] write a script that converts this HTML into markdown [so it can be viewed on GitHub]
  - with pandoc: `pandoc -f html -t markdown puzzle-name.html > puzzle-name.md`
